# River-water-Quality-forecasting
A machine learning project to forecast river water quality using historical data on parameters like pH, DO, BOD, and turbidity. It predicts the Water Quality Index (WQI) and classifies water status to help authorities make timely, data-driven decisions for pollution control and sustainable water management.
